alfresco-colleagues-picker-form-control
=======================================

Limits the people picker to show only users members of the same groups the current logged in user is member

Based on the idea described at https://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Projects_and_Teams_Summit_Hack-a-thon_2014

Write an example showing how to extend the People Picker: Many people want to extend how the out-of-the-box people picker works. For example, maybe when you start a workflow and you are in a site, you only want to search across existing members of the site instead of all of the people in the repository. Create an extension that does that along with a blog post that explains how others could do something similarly.
